npm - package manager. installs packages.
npx - for installing packages only for once just to run that app for now.

example: if u want to call the plumber to fix the tap in ur house, and they say that baad mei bhi kaam ayenge toh ghar pe rkhlo inko; it is npm.
but if u just call him whenever u want, it is npx.
